# Recipes REST

Recipes REST is a web-based application that allows users to create, manage, and share recipes. It provides features such as registering users, adding new recipes, searching for recipes by category or name, updating and deleting recipes, and managing user-specific recipe history.

## Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Spring Data JPA
- Hibernate
- PostgreSQL (relational database)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Maven (build and dependency management)
- JUnit and Mockito for testing

The application, Recipes REST, leverages the Spring Boot framework, which simplifies the setup and development of Spring-based applications. It utilizes Spring Security for user authentication and authorization, Spring Data JPA for database access and persistence, and Hibernate as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework. The application uses PostgreSQL as the underlying relational database for storing recipe and user data.

Recipes REST follows a RESTful API design pattern and includes various endpoints for managing recipes and user registration. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication. The application is thoroughly tested using JUnit and Mockito to ensure the reliability and correctness of the implemented functionality.
